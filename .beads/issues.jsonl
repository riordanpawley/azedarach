Removing explicit `Effect.Effect\u003cvoid\u003e` return types from helper functions (let TS infer)\n  2. Updated `Keybinding` interface to allow `BeadsError` and `KeybindingDeps` (CommandExecutor | FileSystem)\n  3.

Beads ARE present in the database (verified with `bd list` - 76 beads, 26 open, 1 in_progress)\n2. The `SessionManager.stop()` function only removes session tracking, doesn't modify beads\n3. The `bd sync` operation syncs changes FROM worktrees but shouldn't delete beads\n\n**Possible causes identified:**\n1. Error in `BoardService.refresh()` scheduled task causing stale/empty data\n2. Mismatch between session tracking and bead data after sync\n3. Transient issue that's difficult to reproduce\n\n**Root cause could not be definitively identified** - the code looks correct and beads exist in the database.\n\n### Fixes Applied\n\nAdded diagnostic logging to help identify the issue if it recurs:\n\n1. **BoardService.ts**: Added error logging for scheduled refresh failures\n2. **SessionManager.ts**: Added logging around session stop operations:\n   - Log when stopping session\n   - Log when sync completes/fails\n   - Log final session state\n3. **BoardService.ts**: Added warning log when task counts seem inconsistent (0 beads or session mismatch)\n\n### How to Diagnose in Future\n\nIf the bug recurs, check `az.log` for:\n- \"BoardService refresh failed\" - indicates data loading error\n- \"Stopping session for\" / \"Session stopped for\" - tracks session lifecycle\n- \"Sync failed for\" - indicates beads sync issues\n- \"Task load: X beads, Y active sessions\" - tracks data counts\n\n### Status\n\nClosing as \"cannot reproduce\" with diagnostic logging added.
