{"id":"az-05na","title":"add filter mode where i can filter by stuff like status, priority, session, type, etc","description":"","design":"## Filter Mode Design\n\n### Overview\nAdd a menu-based filter mode (triggered by `f` key) that allows filtering tasks by:\n- **Status**: open, in_progress, blocked, closed\n- **Priority**: P0, P1, P2, P3, P4\n- **Type**: bug, feature, task, epic, chore\n- **Session state**: idle, busy, waiting, done, error, paused\n\n### UI Pattern\nFollow the existing SortMenu pattern - a floating panel in bottom-right showing filter options with single-key toggles.\n\n### Key Decisions\n1. **Trigger**: `f` key enters filter mode\n2. **UI Style**: Menu-based (like sort mode) - more discoverable than text syntax\n3. **Persistence**: Filters persist until explicitly cleared (like search)\n4. **Fields**: Core fields only (status, priority, type, session)\n\n### Architecture\n\n#### 1. EditorService Changes\n```typescript\n// New types\ntype FilterField = \"status\" | \"priority\" | \"type\" | \"session\"\n\ninterface FilterConfig {\n  status: Set\u003cIssueStatus\u003e      // Empty = show all\n  priority: Set\u003cnumber\u003e          // Empty = show all\n  type: Set\u003cIssueType\u003e          // Empty = show all\n  session: Set\u003cSessionState\u003e     // Empty = show all\n}\n\n// New mode variant\n| { readonly _tag: \"filter\"; readonly activeField: FilterField | null }\n\n// New state\nfilterConfig: SubscriptionRef\u003cFilterConfig\u003e\n```\n\n#### 2. Keyboard Flow\n- `f` → Enter filter mode (show menu)\n- In filter mode:\n  - `s` → Toggle status sub-menu\n  - `p` → Toggle priority sub-menu  \n  - `t` → Toggle type sub-menu\n  - `S` (shift) → Toggle session sub-menu\n  - Number keys (0-4) → Toggle priority when in priority sub-menu\n  - Letter keys → Toggle specific values in active sub-menu\n  - `c` → Clear all filters\n  - `Escape` → Exit filter mode\n\n#### 3. FilterMenu Component\nSimilar to SortMenu - positioned bottom-right, shows:\n- Current active filters (highlighted)\n- Sub-menu keys (s/p/t/S)\n- When sub-menu active, show toggle options\n\n#### 4. BoardService Integration\nExtend `filterTasks()` to apply FilterConfig alongside search query:\n```typescript\nconst filterTasks = (\n  tasks: TaskWithSession[], \n  query: string,\n  filterConfig: FilterConfig\n): TaskWithSession[]\n```\n\n#### 5. Filter Indicator\nShow active filter count in status bar: `[3 filters]`\n\n### Files to Modify\n1. `src/services/EditorService.ts` - Add filter mode and FilterConfig\n2. `src/services/keyboard/types.ts` - Add \"filter\" to KeyMode\n3. `src/services/keyboard/bindings.ts` - Add `f` binding\n4. `src/services/keyboard/InputHandlersService.ts` - Handle filter mode keys\n5. `src/services/BoardService.ts` - Extend filtering logic\n6. `src/ui/FilterMenu.tsx` - New component (like SortMenu)\n7. `src/ui/atoms/mode.ts` - Add filterConfig atom\n8. `src/ui/App.tsx` - Render FilterMenu, update status bar\n9. `docs/keybindings.md` - Document new bindings","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] `f` key enters filter mode showing FilterMenu\n- [ ] Can filter by status (s key, then toggle specific statuses)\n- [ ] Can filter by priority (p key, then 0-4 to toggle)\n- [ ] Can filter by type (t key, then toggle specific types)\n- [ ] Can filter by session state (S key, then toggle states)\n- [ ] Multiple filters combine with AND logic\n- [ ] Filters persist until cleared (`c` key)\n- [ ] Status bar shows active filter count\n- [ ] Escape exits filter mode\n- [ ] Filtered tasks update reactively across all columns\n- [ ] Documentation updated in keybindings.md","notes":"## Implementation Complete ✅\n\n### Files Changed\n1. **src/services/EditorService.ts** - Added FilterConfig, filter mode type, all filter methods\n2. **src/services/keyboard/types.ts** - Added \"filter\" to KeyMode\n3. **src/services/keyboard/bindings.ts** - All filter keybindings (f, s, p, t, S, e, c, toggles)\n4. **src/services/keyboard/InputHandlersService.ts** - Added filter mode case\n5. **src/services/BoardService.ts** - Extended filterTasks, added isEpicChild computation\n6. **src/services/NavigationService.ts** - Updated to pass filterConfig\n7. **src/ui/FilterMenu.tsx** - New component with sub-menus and hideEpicSubtasks toggle\n8. **src/ui/atoms/mode.ts** - filterConfigAtom, activeFilterFieldAtom, enterFilterAtom\n9. **src/ui/atoms/index.ts** - Exported new atoms\n10. **src/ui/hooks/useEditorMode.ts** - Added filter state and actions\n11. **src/ui/App.tsx** - Integrated FilterMenu, updated modeDisplay\n12. **src/ui/StatusBar.tsx** - Added filter mode keybinding hints\n13. **src/ui/types.ts** - Added isEpicChild to TaskWithSession\n14. **docs/keybindings.md** - Full filter mode documentation\n\n### Features Implemented\n- **f** key enters filter mode\n- **s/p/t/S** sub-menus for status/priority/type/session\n- Toggle individual values within each field\n- **e** toggles hideEpicSubtasks (ON by default - encourages drill-down)\n- **c** clears all filters\n- Filters persist until cleared\n- Combines with text search (/)\n- Reactive updates across all columns\n\n### Type Check: PASSING ✅","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T01:49:34.854715+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T13:51:06.436503+11:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T13:51:06.436503+11:00","close_reason":"Implemented filter mode with FilterMenu component, keybindings for filtering by status/priority/type/session, and documented in keybindings.md","deleted_at":"2025-12-19T10:38:32.622274+11:00","deleted_by":"riordan","delete_reason":"manual delete","original_type":"task"}

This causes:\n- `bun install` to run in pnpm-based projects (wrong package manager)\n- `bd sync` to fail in projects without beads\n\nScreenshot shows: `initCommands failed for Chefy-m3sk` with `bun install` and `bd sync` failures.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `SessionManager.ts:318`:\n```typescript\nconst appConfig = yield* AppConfig\nconst resolvedConfig: ResolvedConfig = appConfig.config\n```\n\nConfig is loaded once at service construction from Azedarach's root, then used for ALL sessions regardless of target project.\n\n## Solution: Load Project-Specific Config at Session Start\n\nModify SessionManager.start() to load config from the target project's path:\n\n1. **Add helper to AppConfig** - Expose a static method `loadConfigFromPath(path)` that reuses the existing loading logic\n2. **Update SessionManager.start()** - Load config from worktree.path (the target project) instead of using the global config\n3. **Merge configs** - Allow target project config to override only the worktree section (keeps Azedarach's session settings)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Export config loading function from AppConfig\nExtract the config loading logic into a reusable function that can load from any project path.\n\n### Step 2: Modify SessionManager.start()\n```typescript\n// After worktree creation, load target project's config\nconst targetConfig = yield* loadConfigFromPath(worktree.path)\n\n// Use target project's initCommands, fall back to Azedarach's config\nconst worktreeConfig = targetConfig?.worktree ?? resolvedConfig.worktree\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle missing configs gracefully\nIf target project has no `.azedarach.json`:\n- Use empty initCommands (don't inherit from Azedarach)\n- This is safer than running wrong commands\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `src/config/AppConfig.ts` - Add loadConfigFromPath export\n2. `src/core/SessionManager.ts` - Use project-specific config in start()","notes":"📎 [mjc8m9za-p8eb.png](.beads/images/az-4w4i/mjc8m9za-p8eb.png) (clipboard, 12/19/2025, 1:15:45 PM)\n\n## Implementation Complete\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **AppConfig.ts** - Added `loadWorktreeConfigFromPath(projectPath)` function\n   - Loads `.azedarach.json` or `package.json.azedarach` from any project path\n   - Returns `WorktreeConfig | null` (null if no config exists)\n   - Fully type-safe, no `as` casting\n\n2. **config/index.ts** - Exported the new function\n\n3. **SessionManager.ts** - Modified `start()` method\n   - Loads worktree config from `projectPath` (target project) instead of using global config\n   - Uses `DEFAULT_CONFIG.worktree` defaults if target has no config (empty initCommands)\n   - Session settings still come from Azedarach's config (intentional)\n\n### Behavior After Fix:\n\n- **Azedarach sessions**: Use Azedarach's `.azedarach.json` initCommands (`bun install`, etc.)\n- **Chefy sessions**: Use Chefy's `.azedarach.json` if it exists, otherwise no initCommands\n- **Any project**: Each project controls its own initCommands via its own config file\n\n### Testing:\n- Type check: ✅ Passed\n- Build: ✅ Passed","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T13:15:42.682605+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T13:58:27.091814+11:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T13:58:27.091817+11:00","close_reason":"Implemented project-specific initCommands loading.

However `space c` (chat) should probably behave differently since it's about spawning a background chat, not immediately switching to it.\n\n## Design Decision\n\nTwo options for `space c` behavior:\n\n**Option A: Match attach behavior (current)**\n- Create chat session and switch to it\n- User can return via Ctrl-a Ctrl-a\n- Downside: Unexpected UX - user is immediately ripped out of TUI\n\n**Option B: Stay in TUI, show toast to attach**\n- Create chat session in background\n- Show toast: \"Chat session started for az-xyz - press Space+a to attach\"\n- User explicitly attaches when ready\n- More consistent with `space s` (start session) which doesn't auto-attach\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nImplement Option B:\n\n1. Remove `switchClient()` calls from `chatAboutTask()` in `SessionHandlersService.ts`\n2. Update toast messages to guide user to attach manually\n3.

This integrates naturally with the epic drill-down flow: user views epic → sees children → decides to spawn parallel workers.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n**Epic drill-down in DetailPanel** must show:\n- List of child tasks (from `bd show \u003cepic-id\u003e` → `dependents` where `dependency_type: \"parent-child\"`)\n- Child status indicators (open/in_progress/blocked/closed)\n- Session indicators for children with active sessions\n- Hint: \"Press 'o' to orchestrate\" when viewing an epic\n\n### Entry Flow\n\n```\nEnter on epic → DetailPanel with children list\n         ↓\n  Press 'o' in detail overlay\n         ↓\nOrchestration overlay (replaces detail)\n         ↓\nSelect tasks → Enter → Spawn workers\n```\n\n1. User presses `Enter` on epic task → opens detail overlay\n2. DetailPanel shows epic info + children list\n3. User presses `o` → `enterOrchestrate()` is triggered\n4. Validates current detail task is an epic (should always be true given UX)\n5. Loads children with session state merged\n6. Pushes orchestration overlay (or transitions detail panel mode)\n7. User selects tasks → `Enter` confirms and triggers spawn\n\n### Mode Definition\n\nAdd new variant to `EditorMode` union in `EditorService.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n| {\n    readonly _tag: \"orchestrate\"\n    readonly epicId: string                      // The epic being orchestrated\n    readonly epicTitle: string                   // For display\n    readonly childTasks: ReadonlyArray\u003cOrchestrationTask\u003e  // Children loaded from bd\n    readonly selectedIds: ReadonlyArray\u003cstring\u003e  // Tasks selected for spawning\n    readonly focusIndex: number                  // Currently focused task in list\n  }\n\ninterface OrchestrationTask {\n  id: string\n  title: string\n  status: \"open\" | \"in_progress\" | \"blocked\" | \"closed\"\n  hasSession: boolean  // Already has active session\n}\n```\n\n### Keybindings\n\n**In detail overlay (viewing epic):**\n| Key | Action | Description |\n|-----|--------|-------------|\n| o | enterOrchestrate | Enter orchestration mode (epic only) |\n\n**In orchestrate mode:**\n| Key | Action | Description |\n|-----|--------|-------------|\n| j/↓ | moveDown | Move focus down in task list |\n| k/↑ | moveUp | Move focus up in task list |\n| Space | toggleTask | Toggle task selection (if spawnable) |\n| Enter | confirmSpawn | Confirm and trigger spawn for selected |\n| a | selectAll | Select all spawnable (open, no session) |\n| n | selectNone | Clear all selections |\n| Escape | cancel | Return to epic detail (or close overlay) |\n\n### Spawn Eligibility\n\nTasks are spawnable if:\n- `status` is `\"open\"` (not in_progress, blocked, or closed)\n- `hasSession` is `false` (no active Claude session)\n\nNon-spawnable tasks shown grayed out, cannot be selected.\n\n### UI Design\n\n**Option A: Orchestration as separate overlay**\n```\n┌─ Orchestrate: Epic Title ──────────────────┐\n│                                            │\n│  [x] az-abc  Implement feature X     OPEN  │\n│  [ ] az-def  Write tests for X       OPEN  │\n│  --- az-ghi  Fix bug Y          IN_PROGRESS│\n│  --- az-jkl  Refactor Z            BLOCKED │\n│                                            │\n│  Selected: 1/2 spawnable                   │\n│                                            │\n│  Enter: Spawn  Space: Toggle  Esc: Back    │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Option B: Enhanced detail panel with mode switch**\nThe DetailPanel itself gains an \"orchestrate mode\" where children become selectable.\n- Simpler implementation (no new overlay)\n- Context preserved (epic info still visible)\n\n**Recommendation:** Option A (separate overlay) for cleaner separation of concerns.\n\n### DetailPanel Enhancement (Prerequisite)\n\nWhen viewing an epic, DetailPanel should show:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Children section -

This spawns a process that takes ~2-3 seconds to complete, during which the UI thread is blocked.\n\n**Flow:**\n1. User presses number key in project selector\n2. `handleProjectSelectorInput()` runs synchronously\n3. `projectService.switchProject()` - fast (SubscriptionRef update)\n4. `overlay.pop()` - fast\n5. `board.refresh()` - **BLOCKS** (calls bd CLI via Command.string)\n6. `toast.show()` - never reached until refresh completes\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Add loading state to BoardService\n- Add `isLoading` SubscriptionRef to track refresh state\n- Set `isLoading=true` at start of refresh, `false=at end\n- Expose via `boardIsLoadingAtom` for UI subscription\n\n### 2. Create loading indicator UI\n- Show spinner/text in StatusBar when `isLoading=true`\n- Message: \"Loading project...\" or similar\n- Non-intrusive, doesn't block interaction\n\n### 3. Make project switch non-blocking\n- In `handleProjectSelectorInput`:\n  - `overlay.pop()` first (immediate UI feedback)\n  - `board.refresh()` via `Effect.fork` (non-blocking)\n  - Toast shows after fork starts, not after completion\n- User sees old data briefly, then board updates\n\n### 4. Consider: Show stale data indicator\n- Optional: dim/gray out board while loading\n- Or show \"Refreshing...\" toast that dismisses on completion\n\n## Key Files to Modify\n- `src/services/BoardService.ts` - add isLoading state\n- `src/ui/atoms/board.ts` - add boardIsLoadingAtom\n- `src/ui/StatusBar.tsx` - show loading indicator\n- `src/services/keyboard/InputHandlersService.ts` - fork the refresh","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Project switching is non-blocking (UI immediately responsive)\n- [ ] Loading indicator shows while refresh is in progress\n- [ ] Board updates correctly after refresh completes\n- [ ] No visual glitches or race conditions\n- [ ] Works for both project selector and initial app load","notes":"## Implementation Complete\n\n### Changes made:\n1. **BoardService.ts** - Added `isLoading` SubscriptionRef that tracks refresh state\n   - Set to `true` at start of refresh\n   - Set to `false` via `Effect.ensuring` (always runs even on error)\n\n2. **atoms/board.ts** - Added `boardIsLoadingAtom` for React subscription\n\n3. **StatusBar.tsx** - Added loading indicator with yellow \"Loading...\" badge\n   - Shows between view mode indicator and keybindings\n   - Non-intrusive, doesn't block interaction\n\n4. **InputHandlersService.ts** - Made `handleProjectSelectorInput` non-blocking\n   - Overlay pops immediately (instant UI feedback)\n   - Initial toast: \"Switching to: {project}\"\n   - `board.refresh()` runs via `Effect.fork` (background)\n   - Completion toast: \"Loaded: {project}\"\n\n5. **atoms/project.ts** - Updated `switchProjectAtom` to be non-blocking too\n   - Same pattern as InputHandlersService for consistency\n\n### Testing:\n- Type check passes ✓\n- Build succeeds ✓\n- Manual testing needed: switch projects and verify UI responsiveness","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T11:03:52.269921+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T11:53:36.034472+11:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T11:24:38.432122+11:00","close_reason":"Implemented non-blocking project switching with loading indicator","deleted_at":"2025-12-19T11:53:36.034472+11:00","deleted_by":"git-history-backfill","delete_reason":"recovered from git history (pruned from manifest)","original_type":"task"}

This causes the loading indicator to flash every 2 seconds during background polling.\n\n**Solution:** Only set `isLoading=true` after a 500ms delay. If refresh completes before 500ms, never show loading indicator.\n\n### File Changes\n\n**`src/services/BoardService.ts`** - Modify refresh() method:\n\n```typescript\n// Before (flashes on every poll):\nconst refresh = () =\u003e\n  Effect.gen(function* () {\n    yield* SubscriptionRef.set(isLoading, true)\n    // ... load data ...\n  }).pipe(Effect.ensuring(SubscriptionRef.set(isLoading, false)))\n\n// After (debounced - only shows if loading \u003e 500ms):\nconst refresh = () =\u003e\n  Effect.gen(function* () {\n    // Schedule delayed loading indicator (500ms)\n    const loadingFiber = yield* Effect.sleep(\"500 millis\").pipe(\n      Effect.tap(() =\u003e SubscriptionRef.set(isLoading, true)),\n      Effect.fork\n    )\n    \n    // Do the actual loading\n    const loadedTasks = yield* loadTasks()\n    yield* SubscriptionRef.set(tasks, loadedTasks)\n    // ... rest of refresh logic ...\n    \n    // Cancel the loading fiber if it hasn't fired yet\n    yield* Fiber.interrupt(loadingFiber)\n  }).pipe(Effect.ensuring(SubscriptionRef.set(isLoading, false)))\n```\n\n### Behavior\n\n- Quick refreshes (\u003c500ms): No loading indicator shown\n- Slow refreshes (\u003e500ms): Loading indicator appears after 500ms delay\n- Background polling: Silent (typically completes in \u003c100ms)\n- Manual refresh/initial load: Shows loading if slow\n\n### Testing\n\n1.

Are NOT parameterized (same for all consumers)\n2. Don't compose across services\n3. Are part of business logic (not presentation)\n\nExample: `filteredTasksByColumn` is computed in BoardService because it's:\n- Not parameterized\n- Core to the board model\n- Used by multiple atoms\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Document when to use services vs atoms\n- [x] Explain effect-atom's actual purpose (React integration, not state management)\n- [x] Show parameterized derivation as key atom use case\n- [x] Confirm current architecture is sound","notes":"Completed research task.

Removed explicit return type from `handleKey` method\n- **Extended BeadsClient** to support all bd CLI fields:\n  - `update()`: Added title, description, design, acceptance, assignee, estimate, labels\n  - `create()`: Added design, acceptance, assignee, estimate, labels\n- **Refactored BeadEditorService** to use BeadsClient instead of running bd commands directly\n- **MAJOR: ID-based cursor navigation** - Changed cursor from index-based {columnIndex, taskIndex} to focusedTaskId: string | null\n  - Eliminates sync issues between UI and services\n  - NavigationService now uses EditorService for search/sort config\n  - Navigation operations find current position in filtered view, calculate new position, store new task ID\n- **Single data source** - App.tsx now uses boardTasksAtom from BoardService instead of separate tasksAtom\n  - When board.refresh() is called, UI updates automatically\n- **Skip empty columns** - Left/right navigation skips empty columns to find next non-empty one\n- **Cursor safety** - After deleting a bead, nav.initialize() moves cursor to valid task\n- **az-451 Data.struct refactor** - SubscriptionRef state now uses Data.struct() for structural equality:\n  - EditorService: EditorMode variants + SortConfig\n  - OverlayService: Overlay objects + emptyArray() singleton\n  - ToastService: Toast objects + emptyArray() singleton\n  - Created src/lib/empty.ts with singleton emptyRecord()/emptyArray()\n\n### Status: TYPE-CHECK PASSES ✓\n\n### Files Modified This Session\n- src/services/NavigationService.ts - Complete rewrite for ID-based cursor\n- src/services/KeyboardService.ts - Updated getSelectedTask to use focusedTaskId\n- src/services/BoardService.ts - Added getFilteredTasksByColumn, getFilteredTaskAt, Map→Record\n- src/services/EditorService.ts - Data.struct() wrapping for EditorMode/SortConfig\n- src/services/OverlayService.ts - Data.struct() wrapping + emptyArray()\n- src/services/ToastService.ts - Data.struct() wrapping + emptyArray()\n- src/ui/App.tsx - Use boardTasksAtom, call refreshBoard on mount\n- src/ui/atoms.ts - Removed cursorAtom, added initializeNavigationAtom, refreshBoardAtom\n- src/ui/hooks/useNavigation.ts - Derives position from focusedTaskId locally\n- src/ui/Board.tsx - Accept readonly TaskWithSession[], Record for jumpLabels\n- src/ui/CompactView.tsx - Accept readonly TaskWithSession[], Record for jumpLabels\n- src/lib/empty.ts - NEW: singleton emptyRecord()/emptyArray()\n\n### Remaining Work\n1. Wire useKeyboardBridge into App.tsx (handleKeyAtom already connected)\n2. Remove any remaining inline handlers from App.tsx\n3. Test all keybindings thoroughly\n4. Consider removing debug logging from KeyboardService\n\n### Recent Commits\n- eccbe28 - refactor: Add Data.struct wrapping to SubscriptionRef state\n- 19beb0a - feat: Add singleton empty collection utilities\n- 092959c - refactor: ID-based cursor navigation and single data source","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-15T00:43:39.319315+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T13:36:38.73138+11:00","closed_at":"2025-12-15T13:36:38.73138+11:00"}

{"id":"az-odr","title":"Fix Space+m merge workflow to prevent merge conflicts","description":"The Space+m (merge to main) workflow has repeatedly failed to prevent merge conflicts from reaching the main branch. This has happened multiple times, requiring manual conflict resolution.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThe current `checkMergeConflicts` in PRWorkflow.ts only does a file-level overlap check (files modified on both branches). This doesn't catch actual content conflicts - Git only discovers those during the merge attempt.\n\n## What's Happening Now\n1. `checkMergeConflicts` compares file lists between branches\n2. If files overlap, shows a confirmation dialog\n3. User confirms (or no overlap detected), merge proceeds\n4. Git attempts merge and finds actual conflicts\n5. Conflicts land on main branch\n\n## Expected Behavior\nThe merge should NEVER introduce conflicts to main. If conflicts exist, they should be resolved in the worktree BEFORE the merge to main happens.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n1. **Perform a test merge first** - In the worktree, do `git fetch origin main \u0026\u0026 git merge --no-commit origin/main`\n2. **Check for conflicts** - If conflicts occur, abort the test merge and report them\n3. **Only proceed if clean** - If test merge succeeds, then push to main\n4. **Auto-abort on conflict** - If test merge has conflicts, abort it (`git merge --abort`) and show which files conflict\n\nThis ensures main always stays clean.","design":"## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1.

This can interrupt the merge mid-execution, leaving the git repository in an inconsistent state.\n\n## Current Architecture\n\n1. **Quit handler** (`src/services/keyboard/bindings.ts:179-191`):\n   - Checks if in drill-down mode (exits drill-down instead)\n   - Otherwise calls `process.exit(0)` immediately\n   - **No check for running operations**\n\n2. **CommandQueueService** (`src/services/CommandQueueService.ts`):\n   - Manages per-task FIFO command queues\n   - Has `isBusy(taskId)` to check if a single task has running operations\n   - Uses `Effect.forkIn(fiber, serviceScope)` so fibers live for service lifetime\n   - **Missing**: Global `isAnyBusy()` to check across all tasks\n\n3. **Merge operation** (`src/services/keyboard/PRHandlersService.ts`):\n   - Enqueues via `helpers.withQueue(beadId, \"merge\", ...)`\n   - Runs as a queued Effect, can take several minutes\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Add `isAnyBusy()` to CommandQueueService\n\nAdd a new method that iterates all task queues and returns true if ANY has running/queued commands:\n\n```typescript\nisAnyBusy: (): Effect.Effect\u003cboolean, never, never\u003e =\u003e\n  Effect.gen(function* () {\n    const state = yield* SubscriptionRef.get(stateRef)\n    return HashMap.reduce(state, false, (acc, taskState) =\u003e\n      acc || taskState.running !== null || taskState.queue.length \u003e 0\n    )\n  }),\n```\n\n### Step 2: Modify quit handler to await running operations\n\nChange the `q` binding to:\n1. Check `CommandQueueService.isAnyBusy()`\n2. If busy, show a toast notification explaining what's running\n3. Set a \"pending quit\" flag and return (don't exit yet)\n4. When all operations complete, the app will exit\n\nOR simpler approach:\n1. Check `isAnyBusy()`\n2. If busy, show toast \"Cannot quit while operations are running\" and block quit\n3. User must wait for operation to complete or can force-quit with Ctrl+C\n\n### Step 3: Add convenience function\n\nExport `isAnyBusy` as a convenience function like existing `getQueueInfo`.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `src/services/CommandQueueService.ts` - Add `isAnyBusy()` method\n2. `src/services/keyboard/bindings.ts` - Update quit handler to check busy state\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Start a merge operation (Space+m)\n2. While merge is running, press `q`\n3. Expected: Toast shows \"Operation in progress\", quit is blocked\n4. After merge completes, press `q` again\n5. Expected: App exits normally","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Pressing `q` while a merge (or other queued operation) is running shows a toast notification\n- [ ] App does NOT exit while operations are running\n- [ ] App exits normally when no operations are running\n- [ ] Ctrl+C still provides a force-quit escape hatch (existing behavior)\n- [ ] The running operation label is shown in the toast (e.g., \"merge\" or \"cleanup\")","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T13:58:23.547877+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T14:15:11.145979+11:00"}

Beads ARE present in the database (verified with `bd list` - 76 beads, 26 open, 1 in_progress)\n2. The `SessionManager.stop()` function only removes session tracking, doesn't modify beads\n3. The `bd sync` operation syncs changes FROM worktrees but shouldn't delete beads\n\n**Possible causes identified:**\n1. Error in `BoardService.refresh()` scheduled task causing stale/empty data\n2. Mismatch between session tracking and bead data after sync\n3. Transient issue that's difficult to reproduce\n\n**Root cause could not be definitively identified** - the code looks correct and beads exist in the database.\n\n### Fixes Applied\n\nAdded diagnostic logging to help identify the issue if it recurs:\n\n1. **BoardService.ts**: Added error logging for scheduled refresh failures\n2. **SessionManager.ts**: Added logging around session stop operations:\n   - Log when stopping session\n   - Log when sync completes/fails\n   - Log final session state\n3. **BoardService.ts**: Added warning log when task counts seem inconsistent (0 beads or session mismatch)\n\n### How to Diagnose in Future\n\nIf the bug recurs, check `az.log` for:\n- \"BoardService refresh failed\" - indicates data loading error\n- \"Stopping session for\" / \"Session stopped for\" - tracks session lifecycle\n- \"Sync failed for\" - indicates beads sync issues\n- \"Task load: X beads, Y active sessions\" - tracks data counts\n\n### Status\n\nClosing as \"cannot reproduce\" with diagnostic logging added.

This breaks all bd commands, including `bd migrate`.\n\n4. **Workaround**: `bd list --no-db` works because it bypasses SQLite entirely and reads from JSONL.\n\n### Why This Affects Azedarach\n\n- `.azedarach.json` has `initCommands: [\"direnv allow\", \"bun install\", \"bd sync\"]`\n- Worktrees run `bd sync` after creation\n- `bd sync` fails → session starts with warning state\n- This is a **beads upstream bug**, not an Azedarach bug\n\n### Solution Options\n\n1. **Immediate workaround (Azedarach)**: Remove `bd sync` from initCommands OR use `bd sync --no-db`\n2. **Proper fix (beads)**: Fix the migration to add the column before referencing it\n3. **Manual fix**: `sqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"ALTER TABLE dependencies ADD COLUMN thread_id TEXT DEFAULT ''\"`","notes":"📎 [mjc92kmr-m2gt.png](.beads/images/az-wxvn/mjc92kmr-m2gt.png) (clipboard, 12/19/2025, 1:28:25 PM)\n\n### Investigation Steps Completed\n1.

This runs:\n1. `nix print-dev-env` - evaluates flake and builds dev shell\n2. `nix flake archive` - GC roots for flake inputs\n\nCache is invalidated when ANY of these files change:\n- `flake.nix`\n- `flake.lock`\n- `~/.direnvrc`\n- `~/.config/direnv/direnvrc`\n\n### What's Already Optimized\n1. ✅ nix-direnv caching (avoids re-evaluation on every shell)\n2. ✅ flake.lock pins inputs (avoids network fetches)\n3. ✅ Simple devShell (only essential packages)\n\n### Potential Optimizations\n\n**A. Enable Nix daemon mode** (if not already)\n```bash\n# Check if nix daemon is running\nlaunchctl list | grep nix\n```\nDaemon mode shares build cache across users/sessions.\n\n**B. Use nix-community/nix-index-database for faster package lookups**\nCurrently not relevant as we're not doing package searches.\n\n**C. Consider devenv.sh instead of raw nix flakes**\ndevenv has faster caching and simpler syntax, but adds dependency.\n\n**D. Profile what's slow in the flake**\n```bash\ntime nix eval .#devShells.aarch64-darwin.default --json\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n**The setup is already well-optimized.** The 11-second delay is inherent to Nix flake evaluation when the cache needs renewal. This only happens when:\n- flake.nix/flake.lock changes\n- First shell in a worktree (no .direnv cache)\n- Nix store garbage collection removes cached derivations\n\n**Recommendation**: No changes needed.
